Starting this winter I began work on a motor controller monitor consisting of an Arduino and an Alltrax AXE motor controller and various other hardware devices such as temperature sensors, Analog-to-Digital converters, an LCD display, LED drivers, Bluetooth serial adapters, and battery monitoring circuitry. The various hardware is interfaced with the Arduino over Serial and RS232 communication protocols.

This project is for the RIT&#8217;s Electric Vehicle Team, and will allow much more information to be presented to the rider of our electric motorcycle than was previously possible. It also can monitor the data that it is receiving from the motor controller and other sensors to shutdown the motorcycle in case of an emergency and potentially log useful information.

Once the project is completed a more detailed description will be provided
