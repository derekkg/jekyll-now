  My name is Derek Gutheil and I am a third year Computer Engineering student at Rochester Institute of Technology.  If you are reading this page and are looking to hire me then <a href="http://derekgutheil.com/hire-me/">this page</a> is where you will find a lot of information about me as well as things that I&#8217;ve done and my resume. The goal of this website is to eventually have all of my projects up on this site in a neat, clear manner.

  Until then though, I am currently the Lead Electronics Engineer for the RIT Electric Vehicle Team where we are building an electric motorcycle to compete in the TTXGP. I am also a TA for the Computer Engineering department and a full time student as well.
